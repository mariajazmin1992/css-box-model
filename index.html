         <p>Michael, look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered? Yes. Interested? Not tonight. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent. Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. If mother sees this, she will blow a cow. Can't a guy call his mother pretty without it seeming strange? Amen. And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cute! It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette.</p>

        <p> I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! A-coodle-doodle-doo. A-coodle-doodle-door. <mark>Could it be love?</mark> I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard.<img src="./130-COVID-Virus (1).png" alt="Covid"> Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary and we don't need anymore lawsuits.</p>
       
        <p>But I didn't take wasn't optimistic it could be done for an answer. For the same reason you should believe a hundred dollar bill is no more than a hundred pennies! Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. Ann certainly has a great deal of Mass. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a… she's the belle of the ball! Heyyyy uncle father Oscar. Look what the homosexuals have done to me! You can't just comb that out and reset it?</p>
